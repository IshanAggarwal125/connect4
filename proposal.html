# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The goal of the game is to play connect 4. One player or two player.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will have a player class and a main class. The player class would contain the constructor in which we will initialize the player's characteristics.
The next task would be to create the object in the main class. In the main class the first thing which will happen is the creation of board. Next, it will make 
the moves and switch players at the same time. In the end, check victory after eveyr move. If it finds victory we will terminate else we will keep running the
algorthm.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No, I am not planning on combining this course's project with any other course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I do not plan on collaborate with anyone else.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating a board and two player connect 4. The only thing with one player is that it woudl require an AI which is not really an easy task to accomplish.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I would be able to create an Artificial inteligence for one player. If not I will definitely have two player ready.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The two player game, text displaying the winner.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Object oriented programming in depth and explore more pygame functions.
